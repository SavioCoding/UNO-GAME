### Game instructions
Your goal is to get rid of all your cards as soon as possible
You can only play cards that have the same color or number as the top card in the discard pile, unless you want to play a black card. Then, you can play it any time you like
You can draw a card during your turn if you cannot or don't want to play your cards
Each player has one and a half minutes to use. The timer starts when it is your turn, and stops when it is your opponent's turn
You lose if your timer runs out first. So, think fast!
After you play your second-to-last card, a red and yellow UNO button appears for you; and
a black and white "U,NO!" button appears for your opponent
If you click your button first, you are save. If your opponent clicked his/her button first, you will get two more cards!
You win if you get rid of all your cards first
You can also cheat by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd>. It makes your opponent's timer go fasterðŸ˜ˆ
You get 0 points if you lose. If you win, the points you get is the number of cards left in your opponent's hand
